# HelpHerInvest
ADAN 8888 Project, the goal is to create a personalized recommendation model that helps individuals to invest 

## Week 1 Identify the problem statement and dataset
1. Identify an opportunity that can be solved with machine learning 
2. Articulate the value of solving the problem and develop a business case 
3. Initiate project in GitHub and set up programming environment in JupyterHub

## Week 2 Ingest and explore the dataset
1. Ingest data into an IDE 
2. Identify what you’re predicting (i.e.,dependent variable) 3. Identify what you’re using as predictors (I.e.,independent variables)
4. Explore the variables in the dataset

## Week 3 Perform exploratory data analysis
1. Split your dataset into training, validation and test datasets 
2. Perform EDA on your datasets
3. Identify problems, opportunities and pre-processing needed

## Week 4 Make data model ready
1. Make data model ready by preprocessing your data based on findings from Week 3 and 4 
2. Perform preprocessing across training, validation and test datasets

## Week 5 Engineer features
1. Create and engineer new features
2. Augment your dataset with new data 
3. Reduce dimensions of your dataset 
4. Create final training, validation and test datasets that will be used in modeling, evaluation and testing

## Week 6 Develop 1st modeling approach (simple, the baseline)
1. Build a very simple set of models appropriate for your problem and dataset 
2. Tune hyper-parameters of the model
3. Select model evaluation metrics, evaluate variations and pick the winning model

## Week 7 Develop 2nd modeling approach (more complex)
1. Build a more complex set of models appropriate for your problem and dataset 
2. Tune hyper-parameters of the model
3. Select model evaluation metrics,evaluate variations and pick the winning model

## Week 8 Develop 3rd modeling approach (even more complex)
1. Build another set of models appropriate for your problem and dataset
2. Tune hyper-parameters of the model 
3. Select model evaluation metrics, evaluate variations and pick the winning model

## Week 9 Select the winning model
1. Evaluate multiple models 
2. Select the best model
3. Calculate performance on the test dataset

## Week 10 Data Centric AI
1. Improve your model by improving the data

## Week 11 Explain the model, analyze risk, bias and ethical considerations
1. Explain your model by understanding feature importance and prediction outcomes 
2. Identify model risks 
3. Identify and quantify bias in your input dataset and model output
4. Identify and measure bias

## Week 12 Save and package your model for deployment. Build your model monitoring plan
1. Save and deploy your model 
2. Build a monitoring plan

## Week 13 Bring it all together
1. To put all weeks together and develop an end to end modeling project with all the artifacts

## Week 14 Review a peer’s work and provide feedback
1. Review a peer’s end to end modeling work and related artifacts
2. Provide written feedback to a peer’s work and artifacts
